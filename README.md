This static HTML/CSS/JS website is deployed through DigitalOcean App Platform, which allows developers to publish code directly from a GitHub repository 
to DigitalOcean servers without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. The domain registration, DNS, security, and speed optimization is provided 
by CloudFlare, which then points the domain to DigitalOcean's servers.
